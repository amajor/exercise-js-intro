# Using the Console & Introducing Operators

Open up your console! For instructions on how to view the console in the Google Chrome Developer Tools, go [here](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools#access).

## Some basic alerts

Let's try a quick bit of code. In that console, type the following:

```
alert("Hello world!");
```

Click enter to run that code snippet.

```
confirm("Cake is better than ice cream.");
```

Click enter to run that code snippet.

```
prompt("Which would win in a race,
the Millenium Falcon or the Serenity?");
```

Click enter to run that code snippet.

## Let's do some math!

Type `3 + 5` and your should see **8** as an output.

Type `3 + 5 * 2` and your should see **13** as an output.

Note that there is an order of operations. Multiplication and division occur before addition and subtraction.

Type `(3 + 5) * 2` to perform the addition before multiplying.

## JavaScript File

Up to this point, all of the JavaScript you've done was in the console.

Obviously an application isn't going to work that way, a user isn't going to just type JavaScript in the console to make things happen. Anything that you type into the console are the same as actions you can perform in a JavaScript file.

Open up the file _script.js_ in your text editor (I like using [Atom.io](http://atom.io)). Open the file _index.html_ in your browser.

Lines of code are commented out with `//` at the beginning of each line. To see that snippet of code run (or at least it's output in the console), remove the `//` to uncomment the code, then refresh your page to get the JavaScript file to run again.
