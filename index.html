            Using the Console and Introducing Operators
          </h1>

          <p>
            Open up your console! For instructions on how to view the console in
            the Google Chrome Developer Tools, go
            <a href='https://developer.chrome.com/devtools#access'>here</a>.
          </p>

          <h2>Some basic alerts</h2>

          <p>
            Let's try a quick bit of code. In that console, type the following:
          </p>

          <p>
            <code>alert("Hello world!");</code>
          </p>

          <p>
            Click enter to run that code snippet.
          </p>

          <p>
            <code>confirm("Cake is better than ice cream.");</code>
          </p>

          <p>
            Click enter to run that code snippet.
          </p>

          <p>
            <code>
              prompt("Which would win in a race,
              the Millenium Falcon or the Serenity?");
            </code>
          </p>

          <p>
            Click enter to run that code snippet.
          </p>

          <h2>Let's do some math!</h2>

          <p>
            Type <code>3 + 5</code> and your should see <strong>8</strong> as an output.
          </p>

          <p>
            Type <code>3 + 5 * 2</code> and your should see <strong>13</strong> as an output.
          </p>

          <p>
            Note that there is an order of operations. Multiplication and division
            occur before addition and subtraction.
          </p>

          <p>
            Type <code>(3 + 5) * 2</code> to perform the addition before multiplying.
          </p>

          <h2>JavaScript File</h2>

          <p>
            Up to this point, all of the JavaScript you've done was in the console.
            Obviously an application isn't going to work that way, a user isn't going
            to just type JavaScript in the console to make things happen. Anything
            that you type into the console are the same as actions you can perform
            in a JavaScript file.
          </p>

          <p>
            Open up the file <em>script.js</em> in your text editor (I like using
            <a href="http://atom.io">Atom</a>).
          </p>

          <p>
            Lines of code are commented out with <code>//</code> at the beginning of
            each line. To see that snippet of code run (or at least it's output in
            the console), remove the <code>//</code> to uncomment the code, then
            refresh your page to get the JavaScript file to run again.
          </p>
